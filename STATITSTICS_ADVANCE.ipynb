        "\n",
        "ans The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most important concepts in statistics, as it explains why the normal distribution is so commonly observed in practice, even when the underlying data isn't normally distributed. The CLT states that, for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with any distribution (whether normal or not), the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution, provided the data has a finite mean and variance.\n",

        "\n",
        "ans.

        "ans A z-score (or standard score) is a statistical measure that describes a data point's position in terms of standard deviations relative to the mean of a data set.

        "\n",
        "ans In statistics, point estimates and interval estimates are both used to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data. They are crucial concepts in statistical estimation, where the goal is to estimate unknown parameters (such as the population mean or proportion) based on observed data.\n",

        "18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Confidence intervals (CIs) are a key concept in statistical analysis because they provide a range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter, such as the population mean, proportion, or difference between groups, based on sample data. They help quantify the uncertainty or reliability of an estimate, making them extremely important for drawing conclusions and making decisions based on sample data.\n",

        "\n",
        "20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions\n",
        "ans Z-scores are incredibly useful when comparing different distributions because they allow you to standardize data from different distributions and make meaningful comparisons, even if the data comes from different scales or units. This is especially useful when comparing datasets with different means and standard deviations.\n",

        "\n",
        "ans The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a foundational concept in statistics that allows us to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. However, the CLT has certain assumptions that need to be met for it to apply correctly. These assumptions help ensure that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approximates a normal distribution, even when the population distribution is not normal.\n",

        "22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution\n",
        "ans The expected value (often referred to as the mean or average) is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It represents the long-run average or central tendency of a random variable in a probability distribution. In simple terms, the expected value is the weighted average of all possible outcomes, where each outcome is weighted by its probability of occurring.\n",

The expected value of a random variable is a key measure derived from the probability distribution that represents the long-term average or central tendency of the outcomes. In essence, the expected value is a weighted average of all possible values of the random variable, with each value weighted according to its probability of occurring.\n",
